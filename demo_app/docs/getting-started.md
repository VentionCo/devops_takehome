# Getting Started

## Installation and startup

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run migrate`
3. `npm run seed`
4. `npm start`

## Setting up an API client

- Install an API client such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
  > For you convenience, I have included a file called `vention_quests_insomnia_collection.json` located at the root of the project. If you have chosen to use Insomnia to make the requests, you can just import the file and start testing.

## Summary

At first I thought that this would be a simple task to build a Rest API, but the concept of compositions made the whole thing more interesting. I have completed all the quests and added some basic error handling. I included various docs that explain the project more in depth and goes over the logic used for each quest. Finally, I included a section for how I could've improved the project.

Here are the various docs

- [Database](./database.md)
- [API Documentation](./api-docs.md)
- [Quests](./quests.md)
- [Improvements](./improvements.md)
